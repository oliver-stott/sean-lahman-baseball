## Tools & Technologies

Advanced MySQL techniques, including:

- Window Functions
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Complex aggregations
- Joins & Unions
- Moving averages & rolling cumulative sums

## Dataset Overview

[**Original dataset available here**](https://sabr.org/lahman-database/)

This dataset contains thousands of Major League Baseball (MLB) player records dating back to the 1870s, sourced from the **Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)**.

## Data Structure & Challenges

The dataset consists of four primary tables:

- `players`
- `salaries`
- `schools`
- `school_details`

**Key observations:**

- Tables are linked via consistent `playerID` values, enabling efficient joins.
- Data inconsistencies exist, such as:
  - Duplicates & whitespace issues
  - Varying data types
  - Date fields requiring concatenation
  - Spread-out data across tables (e.g., player, salary, and team information)

## Project Objectives

The goal is to leverage SQL for data cleaning, optimization, and in-depth analysis of MLB teams. The project is divided into four key sections:

1. **School Analysis:** Which schools produce MLB players?
2. **Salary Analysis:** How do teams allocate player salaries?
3. **Career Analysis:** What are the career trajectories of MLB players?
4. **Player Attributes:** How do players compare in terms of physical characteristics and performance?

Each section provides a detailed breakdown, offering insights into players and teams.

## Methodology

> **Note:** Detailed SQL queries with comments are provided within the corresponding `.sql` file.

- Right-Handed Dominance: The vast majority of players in nearly all teams bat right-handed. This reflects the natural population distribution where right-handedness is more common.

- Left-Handed Consistency: The percentage of left-handed batters tends to be fairly consistent across teams, generally hovering around the 25-30% range.

- Switch-Hitting Rarity: The percentage of switch-hitters (batting with both hands) is relatively low across all teams, typically below 15%. This suggests that switch-hitting is a less common skill.

#### :zap: Average Height and Weight Differences Per Decade

| Decade | Average Height Difference (Inches) | Average Weight Difference (Pounds) |
|---|---|---|
| 1880 | 0.87 | 9.349 |

| 2000 | 0.145 | 9.571 |
| 2010 | 0.076 | 8.971 |

- Height: The decreasing height differences might suggest a convergence in player heights, possibly due to improved nutrition and training methods leading to more consistent physical development.

- Weight: The fluctuating weight differences, especially the recent highs, could indicate changes in player roles, training, and potentially dietary habits (e.g., increased muscle mass). The high weight differences in the 2000s and 2010s could also reflect changes in the sport itself, such as increased emphasis on power hitting.
