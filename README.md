## Tools & Technologies

Advanced MySQL techniques, including:

- Window Functions
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Complex aggregations
- Joins & Unions
- Moving averages & rolling cumulative sums

## Dataset Overview

[**Original dataset available here**](https://sabr.org/lahman-database/)

This dataset contains thousands of Major League Baseball (MLB) player records dating back to the 1870s, sourced from the **Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)**.

## Data Structure & Challenges

The dataset consists of four primary tables:

- `players`
- `salaries`
- `schools`
- `school_details`

**Key observations:**

- Tables are linked via consistent `playerID` values, enabling efficient joins.
- Data inconsistencies exist, such as:
  - Duplicates & whitespace issues
  - Varying data types
  - Date fields requiring concatenation
  - Spread-out data across tables (e.g., player, salary, and team information)

## Project Objectives

The goal is to leverage SQL for data cleaning, optimization, and in-depth analysis of MLB teams. The project is divided into four key sections:

1. **School Analysis:** Which schools produce MLB players?
2. **Salary Analysis:** How do teams allocate player salaries?
3. **Career Analysis:** What are the career trajectories of MLB players?
4. **Player Attributes:** How do players compare in terms of physical characteristics and performance?

Each section provides a detailed breakdown, offering insights into players and teams.

## Methodology

> **Note:** Detailed SQL queries with comments are provided within the corresponding `.sql` file.

							ROUND(yearID, -1) AS decade,
							COUNT(DISTINCT schoolID) AS numSchools
							FROM schools
							GROUP BY decade)
